# Homework 2

This repo should have three files:

1. A homework2.py file that contains your the questions, and which you will commit your code to
2. A gdp.csv file that contains data on the per capita GDP for various countries in and around Europe
3. A popuation.csv file with the headcounts of those countries.

Do not modify the csv files!

You will, at some point, have to create a countries.csv file. Commit that to your homework repo.
